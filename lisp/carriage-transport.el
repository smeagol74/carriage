;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Request watchdog + diagnostics (transport-level, adapter-agnostic)
;;
;; Symptom addressed: UI stuck forever in 'sending/'streaming when adapter never
;; reaches `carriage-transport-complete' or when no progress arrives.
;;
;; Design:
;; - Watchdog is owned by transport layer, not by adapters.
;; - It tracks per-buffer request-id (rid) and last-progress time.
;; - It can be fed by:
;;     - `carriage-transport-streaming' (stream start),
;;     - `carriage-transport-dispatch' (request dispatched),
;;     - `carriage-transport-note-progress' (adapters/stream insertion),
;;     - `carriage-transport-complete' (finalization).
;; - On stall timeout it attempts abort-fn (if present) and *guarantees*
;;   collapsing the request into error via `carriage-transport-complete'.
