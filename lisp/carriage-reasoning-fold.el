;;; carriage-reasoning-fold.el --- Fold begin_reasoning blocks with overlays -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Fold Org-style reasoning blocks:
;;   #+begin_reasoning
;;   ...
;;   #+end_reasoning
;;
;; Requirements:
;; - All existing reasoning blocks should be folded when carriage-mode is enabled.
;; - Newly streamed reasoning should be folded immediately (as early as possible).
;; - When reasoning is completed (#+end_reasoning inserted), it should remain folded.
;; - No auto-reveal by cursor: blocks stay folded by default.
;; - User toggles visibility only via TAB on the placeholder.
;;
;; Implementation:
;; - Overlay-based fold (invisible + before-string placeholder), similar to carriage-patch-fold.
;; - Supports multiple reasoning blocks per buffer.
;; - Debounced rescan after edits to keep overlay ranges in sync.
